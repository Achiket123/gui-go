## Architecture notes

- **Store pattern** — `FinanceStore` holds all state with `Mutate()` + `Subscribe()`,
  similar to Pinia/Zustand. Screens read via `store.Get()` and mutate inside callbacks.
- **Screen interface** — each screen embeds `ui.BaseScreen` and implements
  `Draw`, `HandleEvent`, `Tick`, `OnEnter` — the library's component protocol.
- **Animations** — `animation.AnimationController` drives `Value()` 0→1 for
  bar fills, donut sweeps and intro effects; `PingPong()` drives the pulse.
- **No goroutines needed** — all UI logic is single-threaded on the render loop tick.
